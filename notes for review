Thanks you for putting together a course that brings together Python, Git, and RTFM. The integration of these skills into a game project is a smart and engaging way to reinforce real-world development workflows.

That said, some aspects of the course felt a bit underdeveloped or rushed in execution. Below are some notes I took while taking the course:


 1. Pacing & Instruction Clarity

* In Chapter 2, Lesson 2, the instructions are delivered as a single, large block rather than smaller, digestible steps. This made it harder for dummies like me to follow because there is a lot of opportunity for error and few opportunities to check your work. I think that breaking these big sheets into a few distinct checkpoints or levels (one "level" for each bulletpoint, for example) would provide natural moments to pause, reflect, and understand.


 2. Missing Explanations & Missed Teaching Opportunities

* Several pieces of code are introduced without explanation. This includes elements like infinite while loops, script structure, and certain unexplained syntax that may be unfamiliar to students new to scripting in Python.
* There’s a real opportunity here to connect back to earlier OOP lessons by explicitly showing how principles like encapsulation or class-based design are being applied.
* Comments like *“We’ll use this later”* (e.g. in C2L4) add confusion — if something isn’t used yet, why not introduce it only when relevant?


 3. Instructional Gaps & Unanswered Questions

* Some platform-specific instructions (e.g. “If you're on a Mac, wait until step 8 before doing this”) are left unexplained. These small details can really trip students up if the rationale isn't clear.
* The suggestion to “re-run the game to see reduced CPU usage” could be made more instructive. For example, prompting students to check system resource usage via `htop` or Activity Monitor would make the learning outcome more measurable and satisfying.


 4. Workflow & Debugging Experience

* The decision to run the project across separate small files adds unnecessary complexity for learners who are just beginning to script. It makes debugging more difficult without adding much conceptual clarity at this stage.
* Consider bundling things into a single file early on, then refactoring later as a lesson in modularity and design patterns.


 5. Run/Submit Mechanism

* In places like C2L4, the use of “Run and Submit” felt out of sync with the activity — particularly when the task was just to copy-paste code.
* A better approach might be to let students attempt to write the code themselves, and then use "Run and Submit" to test and validate their solution.
* If copying is necessary for now, perhaps “I’m done” would be a better label to reduce confusion about expectations.


 6. Student Experience

This is the first course in the series where I genuinely considered quitting — not because of the challenge, but because the design felt less thoughtful and more fragmented than previous modules. It often felt like we were being asked to assemble something without being given all the tools or knowing what the final product should look like.
